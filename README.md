# 🧨 Bloxplode Beta

**Bloxplode Beta** is a fast-paced, combo-driven block puzzle game inspired by classic grid-based logic games — but with explosive feedback, escalating combos, and high-score tension.

Place pieces, clear rows and columns, trigger massive chain reactions, and push your score as far as possible before the grid locks you out.
